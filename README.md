# Python_tools
 Here I would like to share with you some useful python tools that I developed : 
 
 - csv_table_to_markdown enables you to convert a csv table to a markdown table code. Then you can put the output on an online markdown editor and it will gives you a beautiful table for a presentation.
- remove_com_in_SAS_code will delete all commentaries of a SAS code.
- which_SAS_table_input will print out, in an excel file, all the SAS table necessary to run the SAS code that you are working with. 
- to_good_path will change the "path format" from the default one to the one that is interpretable by Python, SAS, R or other programming languages.
